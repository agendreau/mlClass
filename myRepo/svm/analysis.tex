For my analysis I explored two kernels linear and radial basis kernel (RBF).  First I filtered the MNIST data from the k-nearest neighbors homework to include only 3's and 8's.  Then I train each kernel on $60\%$ of the data while varying the $C$ parameter, how much we want to avoid misclassifying examples, from $0.001$ to $10000$ increase $C$ by a factor of 10 each iteration to determine which value of $C$ produces the best results.  To determine which $C$ to use I performed cross validation on the remaining $40\%$ of the training data.  The best $C$ is the value which produces the smallest number of errors on the cross validation set.  Once the best value is determined, we train the entire training set using that value and then test our SVM on the test set.  The RBF kernel performed slightly better than the linear kernel.

\section{Linear Kernel}
We found the best $C$ value to be $0.1$ which led to a $59$ total errors on the test set and $2.89\%$ error.

\section{RBF Kernel}
We found the best $C$ value to be $1000$ which led to a $18$ total errors on the test set and $0.88\%$ error.
